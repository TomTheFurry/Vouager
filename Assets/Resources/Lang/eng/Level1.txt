`~Start_P1
In this level, your main goal is to reach the end though a field of space junks.
`~Start_P2
You can also challange yourself by finding and reaching the two special space objects located inside the field.
`~Start_P3
Additionally, if you have <b>Laser</b> equiped, you should try and destroy 200 junks. Be careful with your fuel level!
`~JWST_P1
The James Webb Space Telescope is an infrared space telescope that has been launched. This is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope.
`~JWST_P2
It is designed to provide higher infrared resolution and sensitivity than the Hubble Space Telescope, observing objects 100 times less bright than the faintest objects detected by Hubble.
`~JWST_P3
This will enable a wide range of studies in astronomy and cosmology, such as observations of some of the oldest and most distant objects and events in the universe,
`~JWST_P4
as well as detailed atmospheric signatures of potentially habitable exoplanets.
`~GPS_P1
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is one of the global navigation satellite systems
`~GPS_P2
that provides geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.
`~GPS_P3
It does not require the user to transmit any data, and operates independently of any telephonic or Internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information.
`~GPS_P4
It provides critical positioning capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world.
