`~Start_P1
In this level, your main goal is to reach the end though a field of space junks.
`~Start_P2
You can also challange yourself by finding and reaching the two special space objects located inside the field.
`~Start_P3
Additionally, if you have <b>Laser</b> equiped, you should try and destroy 200 junks. Be careful with your fuel level!
`~JWST_P1
The James Webb Space Telescope is an infrared space telescope that has been launched. This is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope.
`~JWST_P2
It is designed to provide higher infrared resolution and sensitivity than the Hubble Space Telescope, observing objects 100 times less bright than the faintest objects detected by Hubble.
`~JWST_P3
This will enable a wide range of studies in astronomy and cosmology, such as observations of some of the oldest and most distant objects and events in the universe,
`~JWST_P4
as well as detailed atmospheric signatures of potentially habitable exoplanets.
`~GPS_P1
