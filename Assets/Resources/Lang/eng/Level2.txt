`~Voyager_P1
Voyager 1 was launched in 1977, and some of its functions are still functional to this day, and it continues to communicate with NASA's Deep Space Network.
`~Voyager_P2
It is the farthest man-made vehicle ever to travel from Earth, and the first to leave the solar system.
`~Voyager_P3
Thanks to several gravitational accelerations, Voyager 1 is traveling faster than any existing vehicle, preventing its sister ship Voyager 2, which launched two weeks earlier, from ever surpassing it.
`~Voyager_P4
Its main mission ended in 1980 after passing through the Jupiter system in 1979 and the Saturn system in 1980. It was also the first probe to provide detailed pictures of Jupiter, Saturn and their moons.
`~Voyager_P5
In 2012, Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the heliosphere and into the interstellar medium.
`~Start_P1
In this level, you are required to use the several planets around the path to do gravitational accelerations and redirections.
`~Start_P2
There are multiple optional checkpoints guiding you though the path. Be careful not to stay too far away fronm it!
`~Start_P3
Additionally, try to accelerate as fast as possible and hit the center of the goal to get bonus stars.
`~Start_P4
You can also find one hidden object out there which you can fly past as a hard challange!
